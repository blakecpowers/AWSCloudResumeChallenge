# [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/)

In the Cloud Resume Challenge, we'll be learning how to use AWS (Amazon Web Services) to create a cloud-based resume website. This challenge is designed to help you gain hands-on experience with a variety of AWS services, including S3, CloudFront, Route 53, and Lambda.

## Project Overview

The goal of the Cloud Resume Challenge is to build a dynamic and scalable resume website that can be easily deployed to the cloud. This website will be built using a combination of AWS services, including:

- **S3**: A simple storage service that allows you to store and retrieve files.
- **CloudFront**: A content delivery network that improves website speed and performance.
- **Route 53**: A scalable and highly available domain name system (DNS) service.
- **Lambda**: A serverless compute service that allows you to run code in response to events.

Using these services, you'll create a website that is fast, reliable, and easy to manage. You'll also learn about AWS security and best practices for cloud-based website hosting.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Cloud Resume Challenge, you'll need to create an AWS account (if you don't already have one). Once you've set up your account, you can start building your resume website using the AWS services listed above.

Throughout the challenge, you'll have the opportunity to learn about different AWS services and how they can be used to create cloud-based applications. You'll also have access to a community of developers who are working on the same challenge, so you can ask questions, share ideas, and get feedback on your work.

## Conclusion

The Cloud Resume Challenge is a great way to gain hands-on experience with AWS services and improve your skills as a developer. Whether you're new to AWS or you're an experienced developer, this challenge will give you the opportunity to learn new skills and build something that you can be proud of.
